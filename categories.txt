# Email Classification Categories
# Format: CategoryName: Description
#
# These descriptions use a DISCRIMINATIVE approach - they focus on what makes
# each category unique rather than listing everything it contains. The LLM
# uses these alongside the classification prompt's decision framework.

Financial: Communications FROM financial institutions (banks, brokerages, credit
unions, investment firms, credit card companies) ABOUT your accounts, statements,
investments, loans, or tax documents. The sender must be a company whose primary
business is managing money. NOT payment receipts from regular companies like
utilities, cloud services, or retailers - those go to Receipts.

OnlineServices: Account updates and notifications FROM online platforms and
digital services (cloud providers, SaaS tools, hosting, domain registrars,
subscription services) ABOUT billing, features, policy changes, or account
status. These are service providers, not financial institutions. Includes
companies like DigitalOcean, AWS, Stripe, GitHub, Dropbox. NOT transaction
receipts - those go to Receipts.

Receipts: Payment confirmations and invoices FROM any company (except financial
institutions) AFTER a transaction has been completed. The primary intent is
confirming "we received your payment" or "here's your bill." Includes utility
bills, donation receipts, subscription charges, and "payment processed"
notifications. NOT order status updates (those go to Orders) and NOT monthly
account statements from banks (those go to Financial).

AccountSecurity: Security-critical messages requiring immediate attention or
action. Password reset requests, two-factor authentication codes, login alerts,
suspicious activity warnings, account lockout notifications, and verification
emails. The defining characteristic is security urgency - these emails exist to
protect account access. NOT routine account updates about features or billing.

Orders: Order lifecycle communications FROM retailers ABOUT the physical or
digital delivery of purchased items. Shipping confirmations, tracking numbers,
delivery notifications, "your order has shipped" messages, and package updates.
The focus is on fulfillment status, not payment. NOT the initial purchase receipt
(that's Receipts) and NOT marketing about products you haven't ordered yet.

Shopping: Product-focused messages FROM retailers ABOUT product availability,
recommendations, or inventory. Back-in-stock alerts, abandoned cart reminders,
product launch announcements, personalized recommendations, and "you might like"
suggestions. The intent is getting you interested in products, not offering
discounts. NOT promotional emails with sales/discounts (those go to Promotions).

Promotions: Marketing messages FROM any company ABOUT sales, discounts, limited-
time offers, or special deals. Coupons, flash sales, "50% off," loyalty program
rewards, clearance events, and customer satisfaction surveys. The defining feature
is an incentive to act (discount, deal, reward). NOT product availability
notifications without discounts (those go to Shopping).

Events: Invitations and updates ABOUT scheduled events with specific dates/times.
Meeting invitations, calendar notifications, party invites, webinar registrations,
conference announcements, and event reminders from any source (platforms or
individuals). The defining feature is a scheduled gathering or appointment. NOT
healthcare appointments (those go to Healthcare) and NOT general social
correspondence (that goes to Personal).

Personal: Direct person-to-person communication FROM individual humans (not
companies or automated systems) ABOUT any topic. The sender is a real person
using their personal email, and the message is conversational correspondence.
This category takes HIGHEST PRIORITY - even if discussing work topics, if it's
from an individual person communicating personally, it goes here. NOT automated
platform messages, company communications, or newsletters from individuals.

SocialMedia: Automated notifications FROM social media platforms (Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) ABOUT activity on your account. Likes,
comments, friend requests, connection requests, mentions, tags, and "you have
new messages" alerts. These are platform-generated notifications, not the actual
personal messages themselves. NOT messages from individuals (those go to Personal).

Healthcare: Medical and health-related communications FROM healthcare providers,
medical facilities, insurance companies, pharmacies, or patient portals ABOUT
your health, appointments, test results, or medical billing. The sender must be
part of the healthcare system. Includes appointment reminders, prescription
notifications, test results, medical bills, and insurance claims. NOT general
wellness newsletters or fitness app notifications.

Career: Professional development and job-seeking communications ABOUT employment
opportunities, recruiting, or career advancement. Job alerts, recruiter outreach,
interview requests, application status updates, professional networking on
LinkedIn (messages, not notifications), and career coaching. The defining intent
is employment-related opportunity. NOT routine work emails from colleagues
(those go to Personal if from individuals).

TechSupport: Customer support interactions ABOUT resolving a specific problem
or issue. Support ticket updates, troubleshooting responses, help desk replies,
and case status notifications. These emails exist because you reported a problem
and are seeking assistance. The defining feature is reactive problem-solving.
NOT proactive service updates or account notifications (those go to OnlineServices).

Newsletters: Editorial and informational content you subscribed to FROM
publications, blogs, creators, or media organizations. News digests, curated
articles, industry updates, thought leadership, and educational content. The
primary intent is delivering information or knowledge, not selling products.
NOT marketing emails with promotional offers (those go to Promotions) and NOT
transactional service updates (those go to OnlineServices).

Travel: Trip-related confirmations and updates ABOUT transportation and
accommodations. Flight confirmations, hotel reservations, car rental bookings,
boarding passes, itineraries, gate changes, and travel insurance. The defining
feature is related to a specific trip or journey. Includes airlines, hotels,
