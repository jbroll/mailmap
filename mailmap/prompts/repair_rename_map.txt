You previously consolidated {original_count} categories into {consolidated_count} categories, but the rename_map is missing {missing_count} entries.

ORIGINAL CATEGORIES (before consolidation):
{original_text}

CONSOLIDATED CATEGORIES (after consolidation):
{consolidated_text}

EXISTING MAPPINGS (already done correctly):
{existing_mappings_text}

MISSING FROM RENAME_MAP (need to be mapped):
{missing_text}

For each missing category, determine which consolidated category it should map to based on semantic similarity.
Look at the existing mappings to understand the consolidation pattern.
